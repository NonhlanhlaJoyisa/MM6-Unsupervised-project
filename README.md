# MM6-Unsupervised-project
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient recommender system for anime titles, capable of accurately predicting user preferences based on their viewing history and anime content. The system combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

Data

Primary Source: MyAnimeList.net
Secondary Sources (Optional): Anime News Network, Anime-Planet, Social Media Platforms
Dependencies

Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Additional libraries might be required based on chosen algorithms and tools
